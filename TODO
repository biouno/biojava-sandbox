This repository contains simple examples using BioJava. 

The motivation for this repository is to explore the use of BioJava in 
automation and other Java API's. Simple use cases:

- FASTA, GFF and other file formats interpretation and conversion

- A Jenkins plug-in capable of, among other things, plot protein structures
